# Shave the prince

Your goal is to take a picture of a beautiful prince and make an insta post. 
It is important to at least post something if no picture can be taken.

`WithExceptions.cs` tries that but the test sometimes failes and the code looks somewhat cluttered.

Try to change the classes in ResultCastle namespace to handle error scenarios
with the `FunicularSwitch.Result` type. Use your new classes in `WithResults.cs` 
and post on insta under any circumstances.
